Journal Metadata Exchange Format
================================

Journal Metadata Exchange Format (JMEF) is a XML format designed for exchanging information about journals between different systems.

During the course of the CRAFT-OA project, we sought a metadata format capable of facilitating the exchange of journal metadata across different systems.
Initially, we evaluated existing solutions. While numerous formats support the exchange of metadata for scientific articles, very few are designed to accommodate the exchange of metadata for journals. Moreover, the available formats did not fully meet our requirements. In most cases, either the supported metadata elements were too limited in scope, or the format did not utilize XML.

Since we intended to use the OAI-PMH protocol for metadata exchange, having an XML-based format was essential.
As a result, we initiated the development of a new metadata format — JMEF.
